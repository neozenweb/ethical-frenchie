### Ingredients
- 3 cups white basmati rice
- 3 cups water
- 3 tablespoons {{< link href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y7A6PA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003Y7A6PA&linkCode=as2&tag=g0c0d-20&linkId=RMHC5ZEERZ3Y3NG7" content="whey or raw apple cider vinegar" >}}
- 3 pounds ground meat beef, chicken, turkey, venison, or bison
- 1 pound pastured beef or chicken livers optional, but preferred
- 36 ounces various fresh or frozen veggies
- 1 1/2 cups bananas or blueberries optional
- 6 tablespoons {{< link href="https://wildernessfamilynaturals.com/products/cold-pressed-coconut-oil-certified-organic?ref=4" content="coconut oil" >}}
- 6 tablespoons ground flax seed

### Directions
1. Several hours before you want to make the dog food, soak the rice in water with whey or apple cider vinegar.
2. Strain, measuring the amount of water left after soaking.
3. Set aside.
4. Press the Saute button on the Instant Pot.
5. Add the ground meat and break it up and the liver, if using.
6. Cook the meat and liver until they are about half-way browned. You don’t want them to brown completely because you still have to cook the rice and veggies in the Instant Pot, and the meat will burn if fully cooked.
7. Once the meat and liver are half-way browned, add the soaked rice and water, according to the directions in this post.
8.Stir the meat, rice, and cooking water together.
9. Add the veggies on top, but do not mix in.
10. Place the lid on the Instant Pot, making sure it is locked and the vent is sealed.
11. Change the setting to Manual and adjust the time to 12 minutes.
12. When the Instant Pot beeps, carefully turn the vent to release the pressure. You may want to place a towel over the steam to protect yourself and your kitchen from any sputtering steam.
13. Open the Instant Pot and add the fruit (if using) and the coconut oil.
14. Stir everything together, mixing completely.
15. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or freezer for up to 3 months.
